Question 1:
What is jacobian matrix in robotics?
Answer : A Jacobian defines the dynamic relationship between two different representations of a system. It can be used to find end-effector velocity when co-ordinates of joints angles are given.
Question 2:
What is fixed point iteration?
Answer : fixed-point iteration is a method of computing fixed points of iterated functions.
Question 3:
What is newton raphson method?
Answer : Newton's method (also known as the Newtonâ€“Raphson method), is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
